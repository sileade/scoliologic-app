  **Design Movement**: Neumorphism (Soft UI)
  **Core Principles**:
  1. Soft, extruded shapes that mimic physical buttons and cards
  2. Monochromatic color scheme with subtle shadows and highlights
  3. Tactile feel for interactive elements
  4. Minimalist typography to reduce visual noise
  **Color Philosophy**:
  - Base: Very light gray/off-white (#F0F2F5)
  - Shadows: Soft dark (#D1D9E6) and bright light (#FFFFFF)
  - Accents: Soft Purple (#6B46C1) for active states, Soft Green (#00C853) for health indicators
  - Intent: Create a calming, medical-grade interface that feels clean and modern but not sterile.
  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - Card-based layout with "floating" elements
  - Generous padding and rounded corners (20px+)
  - Asymmetric grid for dashboard elements
  **Signature Elements**:
  - "Pressed" state for active buttons (inner shadow)
  - "Floating" cards for content (drop shadow)
  - Circular progress indicators with soft glow
  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - Slow, smooth transitions (0.4s ease-out)
  - Haptic feedback visual cues (button press animation)
  **Animation**:
  - Elements "lift" on hover
  - Smooth fade-ins for content
  **Typography System**:
  - Headings: Nunito (Rounded sans-serif)
  - Body: Quicksand (Friendly sans-serif)

  **Design Movement**: Glassmorphism (Frosted Glass)
  **Core Principles**:
  1. Translucency and background blur to create depth
  2. Vivid, gradient backgrounds visible through "glass" layers
  3. Thin, light borders to define edges
  4. Floating hierarchy based on blur intensity
  **Color Philosophy**:
  - Background: Deep Purple to Blue Gradient (#4A00E0 to #8E2DE2)
  - Glass Layers: White with 10-30% opacity and backdrop-blur
  - Text: White (on dark) and Dark Blue (on light)
  - Intent: Evoke a sense of high-tech innovation and futuristic medical care.
  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - Overlapping layers to show depth
  - Centralized focus with peripheral context
  - Fluid, organic shapes in background
  **Signature Elements**:
  - Frosted glass cards with white borders
  - Glowing orbs in background
  - Vivid gradients for primary actions
  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - Parallax effects on scroll
  - "Shimmer" effects on loading
  **Animation**:
  - Background elements move slowly
  - Glass panes slide in from sides
  **Typography System**:
  - Headings: Montserrat (Geometric sans-serif)
  - Body: Lato (Humanist sans-serif)
